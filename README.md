Hey I'm Jacob! I'm a software developer that loves backend programming (Java, C, C++, C# and even Python if I'm feelin good). I have 7 months of experience with Salesforce
professionally.
I really like embedded systems and working with small VHDL and Verilog programs. I also occasionally enjoy playing around with Real-Time Systems (RTS).
There isn't a lot here but I'm working on a couple projects. Stay tuned!
